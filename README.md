## Welcome to my notebook! I am glad to meet you in this page.

This notebook is for my daily medicine notes. If there are any inappropriate issue, please tell me in the issues module, thanks a lot!



### Here I want to add some markdown syntax, for my future editing.

#### The first is title, you can use # to make a title.

```bash
# is for the first class title.
## is for the second class title.
... ... and so on
```



#### To simply make a list.

##### List of disorder:

```bash
To make a list of disorder, symbols like -, + or * is ok!
- Red
- Green
- Blue

* Red
* Green
* Blue

......
```

##### ordered list:

```bash
To make a ordered list, just type 1, 2, 3 is ok!
1. Red
2. Green
3. Blue
```



#### To quote a sentence, use the >  symbol.

```bash
> This is a quote
> You can use mutiple > like >>> if necessary
> And a nested usage is allowed like this: > #### This is a forth title nested in a quote
```



#### To emphasize a word or a sentence, just add **  or __ (on both side).

```bash
**A bold text**
__Another bold text__
```



#### To create a Italic format, type just one * or _ on both side.

```bash
*A italic text*
_Another italic text_
```



#### Now I just want to make a delete effect on text. Use ~~

```bash
~~A text seems has been 'deleted'~~
```



#### To insert a picture.

```bash
![text](address)
```



#### Or you may want to add a link.

```bash
[Text](link)
simply <link> is ok!
```

Here I am a few tired, update for the next time. Thank you.
